# Using Google Analytics to track interest
This is a very helpful resource to get started:
[Collecting Campaign Data with Custom URLs](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article).  Most of this procedure is based on the guidance provided there.

## Tagging URLs
Google provides a [convenient tool](https://ga-dev-tools.web.app/campaign-url-builder/) for tagging links with tracking information.  I should use this tool every time I add links to my Patreon and Twitter posts.  When using this tool, be sure to:
1. Set the Campaign Source to "Patreon" or "Twitter".
2. Set the Campaign Medium to "Post".
3. Set the Campaign Name to the six digit date of the post (YYMMDD).
