Welcome to Ex-machinis!\r\n
You own drones {{$drone1 }}, {{$drone2}}, and {{$drone3}}. You can send portions of code to execute to each one of them using assigned e-mails {{$drone1 }}@{{ getenv("MAIL_HOST") }}, {{$drone2 }}@{{ getenv("MAIL_HOST") }} and {{$drone3 }}@{{ getenv("MAIL_HOST") }}. The code must be included between tags &lt;script&gt; and &lt;/script&gt;.
