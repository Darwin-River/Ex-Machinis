Welcome to Ex Machinis, a multiplayer space game in which you program remotely piloted spacecraft to mine, manufacture, and trade resources on the edge of the solar system!

You've been assigned three spacecraft ({{$drone1 }}@<?php echo  getenv("MAIL_HOST") ?>, {{$drone2 }}@<?php echo  getenv("MAIL_HOST") ?>, and {{$drone3 }}@<?php echo  getenv("MAIL_HOST") ?>), which you can program and command via email.  The drones will only respond to communications from your email address.

Be sure to check out Getting Started (<?php echo  getenv("MAIL_HOST") ?>/getting-started) for information on how to interact with your ships.
