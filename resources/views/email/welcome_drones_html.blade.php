<p>Welcome to Ex Machinis, a multiplayer space game in which you program remotely piloted spacecraft to mine, manufacture, and trade resources on the edge of the solar system!</p>

<p>You've been assigned three spacecraft ({{$drone1 }}@<?php echo  getenv("MAIL_HOST") ?>, {{$drone2 }}@<?php echo  getenv("MAIL_HOST") ?>, and {{$drone3 }}@<?php echo  getenv("MAIL_HOST") ?>), which you can program and command via email.  The drones will only respond to communications from your email address.</p>

<p>Be sure to check out the <a href="https://<?php echo  getenv("MAIL_HOST") ?>/getting-started">Getting Started</a> for information on how to interact with your ships.</p>
