We are pleased to notify you of your acceptance to the Joint Space Authority’s Federal Assistance Program, which has been established under the authority FR-8323-23 to support and promote the commercialization of space by the grant of fully functional AR324 mining drones to young entrepreneurs.
<br/>
<br/>
Under the terms of the program you have been loaned the use of the drones for up to one year, during which time you are expected to use the government-furnished equipment, to establish an interplanetary commercial entity.
<br/>
<br/>
All communications with these drones will be via email through the International Deep Space Communications Center (DSCC) located in low Earth orbit.  You have been assigned a Virtual Digital Agent (VDA) at the DSCC, which which will help you manage and communicate with your space-bound assets.
<br/>
<br/>
Each of your drones and VDA’s are capable of receiving email instruction via a modified version of the FORTH programming language known as Venture FORTH (vFORTH).   In a series of forthcoming emails, we will introduce you to the basics of vFORTH and drone-based stellar industries.
<br/>
<br/>
You can begin by requesting an asset summary from your VDA.  To do this simply send the vFORTH command “AssetReport” to dscc@<?php echo  getenv("MAIL_HOST") ?>,  This command should be contained in the body of the email and enclosed in by the XML &lt;script&gt; tag as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;script&gt; <br/>
AssetReport<br/>
&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The subject of the email and any text outside of the &lt;script&gt; brackets will be ignored by the VDA and can be used to organize and annotate the emailed instruction for future reference. We will send you further instructions once you have made initial contact with your VDA as shown above.
<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
FAP Administrator
