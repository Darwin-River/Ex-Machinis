# Welcome to _Ex Machinis_

[Ex Machinis](http://exmachinis.wiki) is an online multiplayer space simulation designed to expose players to programming and robotics. In the game, which takes place against the backdrop of our real-time solar system, players program remotely piloted spacecraft to mine, manufacture, and trade goods and services.

The game uses augmented reality to project a parallel universe upon our own. In the game's re-imagined post-war history, world leaders embraced space exploration and colonization as a means of protecting mankind form the global threats that emerged in the wake of the second world war.
