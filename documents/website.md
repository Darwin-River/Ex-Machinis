# Ex Machinis Web Design
Ex Machinis is an information intensive multiplayer sapace game. The game is played primarily by building and programming feets of autonomous spacecraft via email. These spacecraft are capable of accessing, acting, and reporting on the contents of an extensive in-game database. The database holds searchable information on planets, moons, commets, spacracft, resources, and markets.  However, in addition to accessing this information via their spacecraft, players and visitors will be able to browse the game's data sets via a visually intuitive web interface.

# Primary Objectives
The Ex Machinis web interface is intended to address a number of important objectives with respect to gameplay. These functions include:
* **Ranking players.** The web interface serves as an elaborate leader-board for ranking players in the game. Chief among these may be the player's accumulated wealth as expressed in terms of money, resources, and spacecraft. 
* **Trouble shooting code.** The website will give players imediate and intuative access to data that will be valuable for trouble-shooting the performance of the their programmed spacecraft.  Much of this informations will be found in pages which track the inventory and events assoicated with a specific drone.
* **Searching for information.** The web site will allow players to quickly look up the most current infrormation on spacecraft, resources, protocols, markets, and orbital bodies.
* **Community building.** Given the complexities of the game, Ex Machinis players will rely extensively on other players to develop and implement strategies and code. Much of this knowlege and advice will be shared via a discussion board, which will be accessed via that web interface.

# Core Design Principles
There are a number of core design principles, which will be used to guide the construction of our web interface.
* **There are no logins.** All of the game's manuals, tutorials, discussion boards, and data sets are imdiately available to player's alike.
* **The GUI renders well on mobile devices.** Ex Machinis is a persustant simulation which never stops.  Therfore it is important that players can access the universe from multiple platforms, including their smartphones and tablets.  Email provides one mechanism for ensuring uninterupted access to the game.  An opern web interface which accomodates a broad range if devices is another improtant criteria for ensuring the broades possible access.
* **Everything is inter-linked.** The web interface encourages users to browse and explore in-game data by extensively interlinking elements.  Whenever possible, references to planets, moons, asteroids, spacecraft, and resources, will be linked to subject-specific data sheets containing more information on that and related objects.  For example, a company's profile will list its spacrafts. Clicking on the name of one of its spacracft will take you to a page that shows the ship's location and resources.  Selecting the location will show you other spacecraft in the area as well as a list of mineable resource.  Any of those spacecraft or resources can be selected to access further datails on the subject.
