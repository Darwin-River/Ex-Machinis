# Ex Machinis Player's Manual

The Player’s Manual provides a detailed description of available game-play mechanics and strategies.  This manual will grow with the game.  As more features are added, they will be introduced below.  Currently, the manual focuses primarily on coding spacecraft with the fully developed FORTH interpreter.  However, as we develop the more physical components of Ex Machinis game play more details will be provided on navigation, resource extraction, refining, and production.  Thank you for your support and please stay tuned for future developments!

## Chapter 1: Overview {#overview}
### Your fortune awaits!
Ex Machinis is a multiplayer space game, which takes place in a parallel universe. Within this altered reality, space technologies have rapidly advanced since the 1950’s to the point where extensive interplanetary industries exist to produce materials that drive the human economy back on Earth. The vast majority of these spacecraft and are unmanned vehicles, which are assembled in space and are controlled terrestrial barons.

As part of the international agreement that drove the colonization of space at the end of the second world war, citizens of the signitor nations are guaranteed access to basic spacecraft which can be used to build profitable businesses.  This democratization of space has been the biggest driver behind the rapid growth of extraterrestrial industries and technologies.

It is your birthright to take control of your own remotely piloted spacecraft and build a thriving stellar industry.  But this can only be accomplished by programming your spacecraft to efficiently mine, manufacture, and trade materials on the interplanetary economy.
### We still have light years to go
Ex Machinis is in the very early stages of development but we want to make it available to potential players so they can kick the tires and provide us with valuable feedback and suggestions.

We currently have a functional email server that allows players to create an account and code a fleet of three spacecraft using a FORTH compiler.  The spacecraft are able to process simple FORTH commands but can’t execute any in game activities yet.

Right now we’re developing the Event Engine that will govern the physical actions of spacecraft.  When the Event Engine comes online, your drones will be able manufacture materials move from one location to another.

This player’s  guide is a work in progress.  It will be updated as new features become available in the game.  Please follow us on **[Patreon](http://patreon.com/exmachinis)** to receive updates and find the latest version of this guide.
